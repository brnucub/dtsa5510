Image Classification task via K-Means and K-Medoids Clustering as an experiment to see how well this does on image classification data.

Two clustering methods are compared by clustering labeled data and choosing a id-to-label mapping that maximizes the training accuracy, thereafter using that mapping to classify test data.
